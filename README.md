# Shell.ai-Hackathon-for-Sustainable-and-Affordable-Energy-2021

This hackathon focused on helping Solar power plant owners. This hackathon aimed to predict Global Horizontal Irradiance and cloud coverage for a stretch of 2-hour at an interval of 10 minutes, resulting in 12 predictions over the 2-hour window subject to the availability of a minimum 2-hour window of prior data. Predicting the intermittency in advance can help the grid operators to schedule deferrable loads to run on clean solar power, increasing the overall share of clean power in the energy mix.
